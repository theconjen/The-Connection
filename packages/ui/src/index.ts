// UI component exports
// Platform-specific components will be exported from their respective files
// using .web.tsx and .native.tsx extensions

// NOTE: Core web/native shared components now live here with platform splits.
// Remaining primitives from `mobile-app/TheConnectionMobile/assets` can be
// migrated incrementally as part of the component migration phase.

// Currently implemented components (web + native):
export * from './Dialog/Dialog';
export * from './Badge/Badge';
export * from './Select/Select';
export * from './Form/Form';
